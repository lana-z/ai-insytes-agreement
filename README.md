# Work Plan

NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks. 

### Describe at least:
### How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

We’ll start our standup with review of PM tool and decide what we’ll work on from that

What project management tool will be used?

Github project management


# Git Process
Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.
### What components of your project will live on GitHub?

All repositories

### How will you share the repository with your teammates?

Create an organization profile on GitHub so everyone has access to the repositories

### What is your Git flow?
- Main Branch: The main branch should always contain production-ready code. Consider this the stable branch. `git checkout main`
- Dev Branch: The Dev branch is where active development occurs. It's a branch from which feature branches are created. `git checkout -b dev`
- Feature Branch: Each new feature or bugfix should be developed in a feature branch branching off from dev. `git checkout -b feature/new-feature develop`
- Once the feature is complete, it's merged back into dev branch. 
- Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:

### How many people must review a PR? At least 2
Who merges PRs? Primary person who wrote the code (once review complete)

### How often will you merge? 
Daily, or as needed for major update

### How will you communicate that it’s time to merge? 
Slack and all other collaboration communication
